My special theme for my favourite terminal environment :D
*Download the theme into oh-my-zsh's custom themes directory:$ mkdir -p $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrsangrin/oh-my-mrsangrin-theme/master/oh-my-mrsangrin.zsh-theme -L -o $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/oh-my-mrsangrin.zsh-theme
*Set the theme in your .zshrc file: ZSH_THEME="oh-my-mrsangrin"
With Iterm2/3 use monokai_soda for more "prettification".
